# Project Blueprint: The Digital Mystic

## Overview

This document outlines the design and development of "The Digital Mystic," a multi-feature web application designed for user engagement and monetization through Google AdSense. The goal is to create a visually bold, interactive, and shareable experience that encourages repeat visits.

## Core Features

1.  **Fortune Cookie:** The original feature. A user clicks a cookie to get a random fortune.
2.  **Tarot Card of the Day:** A user draws a single, beautifully designed tarot card for a quick piece of daily guidance. The card will have a flip animation and a short interpretation.
3.  **The Mystic Orb:** An interactive Magic 8-Ball. A user asks a question, clicks the orb, and receives an animated, mysterious answer.

## Design & Aesthetics (Bold Definition)

*   **Layout:** A single-page application with a clear, icon-based top navigation to switch between the three features. The layout will be responsive for both mobile and desktop.
*   **Color Palette:** A primary palette of deep purple, midnight blue, and gold accents to create a mystical and premium feel.
*   **Typography:** A combination of a serif font like 'Playfair Display' for titles and a clean sans-serif for body text. A cursive font like 'Caveat' for emphasis.
*   **Visual Effects:**
    *   **Depth:** Multi-layered drop shadows on UI elements like cards and buttons to create a sense of depth.
    *   **Glow:** Interactive elements will have a soft "glow" effect on hover to guide the user.
    *   **Texture:** The main background will have a subtle, starry noise texture for a tactile, premium feel.
*   **Interactivity:** Smooth animations for card flips, orb shaking, and content transitions.

## Monetization Strategy

The application is designed with ad placements in mind. The multi-feature layout increases page views and session duration. Potential ad placements include a banner in the header/footer and a content block between sections, ensuring they are visible but not intrusive to the user experience.

## Development Plan

### Current Phase: Feature Expansion & Redesign

*   **Objective:** Transform the single-feature "Cosmic Fortune Cookie" into the multi-feature "The Digital Mystic."
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Update `index.html`:** Create the new structure including a navigation bar, and sections for each of the three tools.
    2.  **Update `style.css`:** Implement the full "Bold Definition" redesign. Style the navigation and the layout for all three sections.
    3.  **Update `main.js`:** Refactor the code to handle navigation and the logic for all three separate tools.
